# re[Mod] - The on-the-fly weapon-building arena FPS

This repository holds the source code for re[Mod], my [senior capstone project](https://jameskeats.com/portfolio/remod.html) from college. All of the assets (PNGs, TGAs, FBXs, etc.) have been purged from the history of this repo, so this project cannot simply be cloned and run. It is supplied instead primarily as a code reference.

If you want to download and play a build of re[Mod], check out our [itch.io page](https://thefiringsquad.itch.io/remod).
